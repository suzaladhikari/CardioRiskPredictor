# CARDIO VASCULAR DISEASE PREDICTOR 
## Welcome to the ML-Powered Web application that helps you to predict the risk of developing the cardiovascular disease from your daily habits and lifestyle indicators. The whole purpose of this project is to analyze the relation between the data science and health sector.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This app is purely made for educational purpose. Please do not use it for your clinical and diagnostic reasons.
---
## Features of the app 
- You can easily input the data through the sliders and checkboxes, the UI is pretty simple and straightforward.
- Prediction of cardiovascular disease likelihood using machine learning
- The five most commonly used models has been trained, tested, hypertuned, and compared to find the right pick which works perfectly in the realtime data.
- Different evaluation metrics: precision, accuracy, recall, roc_auc_score, and precision_recall curve has been used to compare the model's performance.
- Clean UI, Developer Info, and Disclaimers are taken as the pre-dominant consideration.

## Learnings from the Project

- Built a full-cycle machine learning pipeline ‚Äî from data cleaning, EDA, and hypothesis testing to feature engineering, model selection, and deployment.

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, outliers, and correlations in lifestyle and health factors.

- Conducted hypothesis testing to validate assumptions and guide feature selection.

- Compared multiple classification models and evaluated them using precision-recall curves, ROC-AUC, and key performance metrics.

- Developed a clean, interactive Streamlit web application to make the ML model accessible and informative for end users.

- Gained hands-on experience with industry-standard tools like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Streamlit.
